# Method 1:
# Dynamic Programming Approach: (1d DP)

'''
We initialize a dp array where each value represents whether you can jump to the end from that index.

Start from the second last index (n-2) and go backward.

For each index i, check if you can jump to an index j such that dp[j] is True.
If yes, set dp[i] = True.

Finally, return dp[0] â€” it tells us whether we can reach the end from the beginning.

"""
TIME COMPLEXITY :
-> The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^2) in the worst case, where n is the length of the input array nums.
-> This is because for each index, we may need to check all possible jumps to the end, leading to a nested loop.

SPACE COMPLEXITY :

-> The space complexity is O(n) due to the dp array used to store whether each index can reach the end.
-> This is necessary to keep track of the reachable indices from each position in the array.

# Method 2: 

# Intution :

# Our goal is to reach the (n-1)th index of the array, starting from the 0th index. If reach, return True, else return False.
# To find if we can do that , we have 2 methods - Greedy and Dp 

# Greedy Approach:

# We will keep track of the maximum index we can reach at each step.
# If at any point, the maximum index we can reach is less than the current index, we cannot proceed further and we break out of the loop.

# The maximum index that can be reached from the current index is calculated as `i + nums[i]`, where `i` is the current index and `nums[i]` is the value at that index.
# We keep updating the maximum index we can reach as we iterate through the array.

# If we reach the (n-1)th index, we return True.
# If we finish the loop without reaching the (n-1)th index, we return False.

# Time: O(n), space: O(1)
