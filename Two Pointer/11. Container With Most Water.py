# Method 1:
# Brute Time Complexity :  O(n^2) , Space Complexity:O(1)
# find the area between every pair of container and take the maximum
''' Approach :
    1)in this brute force approach we have to take all possible pairs of l and r to find the maximum area between l and r
    2)length = l-r
    3)width  = minimum of (height[r], height[l])
    3) Area = length * width

# Method 2: 
# using two pointer

# Idea: 
# 1) The widest container (using first and last line) is a good candidate, because of its width.
# Its water level is the height of the smaller one of first and last line.
# 2) All other containers are less wide and thus would need a higher water level in order to hold more water.
# 3) The smaller one of first and last line doesn't support a higher water level and can thus be safely removed from further consideration.

# So we can start from two end points and move the pointer for which height is less.
# From here we get idea of two pointer.

# time: O(n)
# Space :O(1)
