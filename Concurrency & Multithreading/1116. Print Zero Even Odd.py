sem_zero starts at 1 â†’ lets zero() run first.

zero() prints 0, then:

If odd â†’ releases sem_odd

If even â†’ releases sem_even

odd() / even() print the number, then release sem_zero to allow the next 0.

What is a Semaphore?

A semaphore is a synchronization primitive that can be used to control access to a common resource in concurrent programming. 
It maintains a set of permits, which threads can acquire and release.

    Permits: The number of permits indicates the number of threads that can access the resource simultaneously.
    Acquire: Decreases the number of available permits. If no permits are available, the thread is blocked until a permit is released.
    Release: Increases the number of available permits, potentially unblocking a waiting thread.

Java Semaphore Class

In Java, semaphores are provided by the java.util.concurrent.Semaphore class.
Constructor

    Semaphore(int permits): Creates a semaphore with the given number of permits and non-fair access policy.
    Semaphore(int permits, boolean fair): Creates a semaphore with the given number of permits and the specified fairness policy. 
    Fairness means granting permits in the order in which they were requested.

Key Methods

    acquire(): Acquires a permit if one is available, blocking the thread until a permit is available.
    release(): Releases a permit, returning it to the semaphore.
    tryAcquire(): Acquires a permit if one is available and returns true, otherwise returns false.

What is a Semaphore?

A semaphore is a synchronization primitive that can be used to control access to a common resource in concurrent programming. 
It maintains a set of permits (represented by a counter), which threads can acquire and release.

    Permits: The counter value indicates the number of threads that can access the resource simultaneously.
    Acquire: Decreases the counter (wait operation). If the counter is zero, the thread is blocked until another thread releases.
    Release: Increases the counter (signal operation), potentially unblocking a waiting thread.

C++ Semaphore Support

In C++, semaphores are available through the POSIX semaphore API (on POSIX-compliant systems) using the <semaphore.h> header.

Initialization

    sem_t sem;
    sem_init(&sem, 0, permits); 
    // Initializes a semaphore with a given number of permits. 
    // The second parameter is 0 for thread-shared (within process).

Key Functions

    sem_wait(&sem): Acquires a permit if one is available, blocking the thread until a permit becomes available.
    sem_post(&sem): Releases a permit, incrementing the counter and potentially unblocking a waiting thread.
    sem_trywait(&sem): Attempts to acquire a permit without blocking. Returns 0 on success, or -1 if no permits are available.

Destruction

    sem_destroy(&sem): Destroys the semaphore and releases associated resources.
