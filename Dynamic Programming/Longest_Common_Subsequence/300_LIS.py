# If we closely observe the problem then we can convert this problem to longest Common Subsequence Problem.
# Firstly we will create another array of unique elements of original array and sort it. 
# Now the longest increasing subsequence of our array must be present as a subsequence in our sorted array. 
# Thatâ€™s why our problem is now reduced to finding the common subsequence between the two arrays.

# Time and Space: O(n^2)
# submited successfully on GFG but giving TLE on Leetcode

    #Function to find length of longest increasing subsequence.

# method 2: submitted on leetcode
# logic: traverse the array from right to left 
# e.g: LIS[2] means nums[2] will get appened(+1) to the LIS of any of the previous LIS(i.e if all the ele of of any of the LIS will be grater than nums[2] then we will add +1)

                    LIS[i]= max(LIS[i], 1+ LIS[j])
        # at last return the maximum in LIS
        return max(LIS)


# if you traverse from starting left to right

# just the little explanation of above one
# in this we are tracking the pre_ind also to which we are adding the curr ele if it follows the sequence
# pre_ind denotes the last index included in LIS
# pre_ind range [-1, n-1] & ind will range from [0, n-1] (at n it will return)
class Solution:

            ans= max(ans, 1+ self.helper(ind +1, ind, arr))
        return ans


# memoizing the above method
# for matrix: we can't store -1 as pre_ind so we will do co-ordinate shift by +1 i.e for -1 we will write 0 and so on
# so in this range of pre_ind will be from [0, n+1]
