# If we closely observe the problem then we can convert this problem to longest Common Subsequence Problem.
# Firstly we will create another array of unique elements of original array and sort it. 
# Now the longest increasing subsequence of our array must be present as a subsequence in our sorted array. 
# Thatâ€™s why our problem is now reduced to finding the common subsequence between the two arrays.

# Time and Space: O(n^2)
# submited successfully on GFG but giving TLE on Leetcode

# write the logic in notes in detail
class Solution:
    #Function to find length of longest increasing subsequence.

# other methods: good ones
# in this we are tracking the pre_ind also to which we are adding the curr ele if it follows the sequence
# pre_ind denotes the last index included in LIS
# in case of pick and non_pick always write the pick case and non_pick case separately if there are some condition involved before including or not_including any ele
# time: O(n^2)
# space: O(n)

# memoizing the above method
# for matrix: we can't store -1 as pre_ind so we will do co-ordinate shift by +1 for pre_ind i.e for -1 we will write 0 and so on
# so in this range of pre_ind will be from [0, n] instead of '-1' to   and range of 'ind' from '0' to 'n-1'

# other way (neetcode): 
# method 2: submitted on leetcode
# logic: traverse the array from right to left 
# e.g: LIS[2] means nums[2] will get appened(+1) to the LIS of any of the previous LIS(i.e if all the ele of of any of the LIS will be grater than nums[2] then we will add +1)     
# very better one

        # at last return the maximum in LIS
        return max(LIS)


# if you traverse from starting left to right
