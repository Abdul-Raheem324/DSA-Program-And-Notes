# If we closely observe the problem then we can convert this problem to longest Common Subsequence Problem.
# Firstly we will create another array of unique elements of original array and sort it. 
# Now the longest increasing subsequence of our array must be present as a subsequence in our sorted array. 
# Thatâ€™s why our problem is now reduced to finding the common subsequence between the two arrays.

# Time and Space: O(n^2)
# submited successfully on GFG but giving TLE on Leetcode

# write the logic in notes in detail

# converting to Tabulation VVI: Top down 
# little twist here: different from general pattern.
# Rules: 1) write the base case
# 2) convert the indices into for loop by seeing the starting and ending point of indices.
# Here 'ind' will go from 'n-1' to '0'. 
# And 'pre_ind' will go from 'n-1' to '-1' but it can't be equal to ind , it will be always less than the 'ind'..So it will from 'ind-1' to '-1'.
# 3) copy paste the recurrence do coordinate shift of '1' in case of 'pre_ind'. That's it.

# logic: we will compare end element of sub with element under iteration 'num'. If 'num' is bigger than last ele of sub, we just extend our list. 
# Otherwise, we will simply apply binary search to find the smallest element >= num and replace it.

# Note vvi: 'sub' will not give the one of the LIS but it will give the correct ans for LIS.

# why this logic is giving correct ans?
# Ans: Replace karenge tb length to wahi rhega but smaller ele se replace karne pe next ele ka append hone ka chance increase kar jayega.
# kyonki chota se replace kar rhe. e.g: [2, 8] next ele is '3'. after replacing => [2,3] ab agar next elements '3' se large hua to append kar denge directly,
#  but agar [2,8] hota tb sirf '8' se bda wale ko hi append kar pate. 
# Append kitna jayda ho rha last me wahi mera length ko increase karega..
