# If we closely observe the problem then we can convert this problem to longest Common Subsequence Problem.
# Firstly we will create another array of unique elements of original array and sort it. 
# Now the longest increasing subsequence of our array must be present as a subsequence in our sorted array. 
# Thatâ€™s why our problem is now reduced to finding the common subsequence between the two arrays.

# Time and Space: O(n^2)

# method 3: Better one
# Just the same above logic only, different way to write.

# How?
# There is no need to check the possibility of 'taking' and 'not taking' in possible case.
# There is always one choice to 'not take' and we can only take if follows the sequence.

# in case of pick and non_pick always write the pick case and non_pick case separately 
# if there are some condition involved before including or not_including any ele.

# best one: using binary search to find the proper position of curr index in case not follows the pattern 
# and removing the curr ele at that index in 'subsequence'.

# How Binary search?
# Since LIS will be in strictly sorted order only.
# if cur ele follows the sequence i.e > pre added one then, we will add this directly i.e
# If 'num' is bigger than last ele of sub, we just extend our list 
# Otherwise, we will simply apply binary search to find the smallest element >= num and replace it.

# why this logic is giving correct ans?
# Ans: Replace karenge tb length to wahi rhega but smaller ele se replace karne pe next ele ka append hone ka chance increase kar jayega.
# kyonki chota se replace kar rhe. e.g: [2, 8] next ele is '3'. 
# after replacing => [2,3] ab agar next elements '3' se large hua to append kar denge directly,
#  but agar [2,8] hota tb sirf '8' se bda wale ko hi append kar pate. 
# Append kitna jayda ho rha last me wahi mera length ko increase karega..

# Note: if we will use 'bisect_right' then we get duplicates also if 'num' is already  in 'sub' so using 'bisect_left'
#  since we need to replace with smallest ele in sub >= num.
# If we use 'bisect_right' then, it will replace with next greater ele than 'num', so we may get duplicate like pre and num will be same only.

# Note vvi: 'sub' will give one of the 'LIS' .
