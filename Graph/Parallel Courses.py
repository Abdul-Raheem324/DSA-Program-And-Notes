# Note: In one semester you can study any number of courses as long as you have studied all the prerequisites for the course you are studying.


# Ans: the minimum number of semesters needed to study all courses is determined by the longest acyclic path, i.e, 
# we are looking for the longest acyclic path with each edgeâ€™s weight being 1.

# Observation: prerequisite thing(means topological sort) + maximum path wirth equal weight (multosource bfs)

# Logic: Just topological sort + multisource bfs
# Only converted the code of topogical sort into multisource bfs.
