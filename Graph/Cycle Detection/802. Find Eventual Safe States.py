Note: Terminal nodes has no outgoing vertices so these can't be part of a cycle.
And safe nodes will have all its edges to terminal nodes only so this also can't be part of any cycle.

Except these nodes i.e terminal and safe all nodes will be part of cycle .

logic of above: since terminal will be the nodes having no adjacent node and 
safe nodes are those nodes which have only terminal or safe node as adjacent node.
i.e if any node reaches to any terminal or safe node then it will not go back. so will not form a cycle.

vvi: So basically we have to find the 'nodes which doesn't belong to any of cycle formed'.

One thing to keep in mind:
Also we do not have to include those nodes which is directly not included in cycle but is a part of cycle i.e 
it is directly connected to any node which is directly included in the cycle.

how to solve: just try to find the cycle and if you don't encounter a cycle 
then all nodes from starting to where call ended(will end only at any terminal node)
will be safe only since they are not part of any cycle.

exactly same code as cycle detction in directed graph using dfs.
only one extra line added to include the node in the ans that's it.

Note: All terminal node is a safe node since all paths from terminal node go to same terminal node.

# Method 2: Kahn's Algo only
"""
Nodes that do not lead to a cycle are called "eventual safe nodes".
If we reverse the graph, then terminal nodes (no outgoing edges) become sources.
Using Kahnâ€™s algorithm (topological sort) on the reversed graph, we can find all nodes
that eventually lead to terminal nodes (i.e., safe nodes) by following paths backwards.
Any node that can reach a terminal node without hitting a cycle is marked safe.
