# Leetcode solution: 2nd method(Mooreâ€™s Voting Algorithm): 
# basic meaning: just cancel each other vote.
# it gives the majority ele i.e that has occured more than n/2 times
# by balancing the count i.e after seeing any other element, it 
# decreases the count if count is zero and  'm' is not equal to the current element.
# at alst 'm' will give the majority element



# note: only valid for majority ele if they occur for sure. will not give the ele which has occured maximum no of times
# if the max_fre ele occur at the start then count will get decrement to '0' later and 'm' will have different ele at last
# then will give incorrect ans
