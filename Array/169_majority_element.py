# Method 2: 

# if given majority elements always exist and array is sorted
# in this case middle index must be the index of majority element
# in this case, time: O(1), just return the middle ele 

# but here we are sorting then returning the mid ele so, time: 0(nlogn)

# Method 3: Better one and Q is based on this only.

# Algo: (Mooreâ€™s Voting Algorithm)
# basic meaning: just cancel each other vote.
# it gives the majority ele i.e that has occured more than n/2 times
# by balancing the count i.e after seeing any other element, it 
# decreases the count if count is zero and  'm' is not equal to the current element.
# at alst 'm' will give the majority element

# note: only valid for majority ele if they occur for sure. will not give the ele which has occured maximum no of times
# if the max_fre ele occur at the start then count will get decrement to '0' later and 'm' will have different ele at last
# then will give incorrect ans 

# Time: O(n) , space : O(1)

                cnt+= 1
            else:
