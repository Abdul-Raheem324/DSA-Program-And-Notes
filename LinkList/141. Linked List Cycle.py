This is not efficient because it checks the length of the linked list against a fixed maximum value (10001 in this case).
# This approach does not actually detect cycles; it only checks if the length exceeds a certain limit.

Analysis:
Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list.
Space Complexity: O(1), as it uses a constant amount of space for the length variable.
# This method does not correctly identify cycles in the linked list.
